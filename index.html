                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <p>Programming is the dawn of all things creative. You can do literally anything. Learning how to program is just like learning another language to speak, except easier, as you don't have to speak to people, you're just speaking to a
                        compiler or interpreter. You're also constantly being judged on how you speak, so improvement is inevitable. Programming isn't hard, it's just a lot of learning.</p>
